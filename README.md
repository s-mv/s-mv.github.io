# Hi there
smv here
## 🔭 I’m currently working on:  
I'm working on making stuff to present on GitHub -as I love to show off- and am trying to find fun and challenging ideas.
## 🌱 I’m currently learning:  
I am learning C++ right now, it's easier to pick up since I've been coding for a while now.
## 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on:
I'd love to work on porjects related to game development, I've been using Godot since 2020 and have made some games from scratch in JS before that. I like to think of innovative ideas for making games or interesting algorithms.
## 🤔 I’m looking for help with:  
Nothing right now...
## 💬 Ask me about:  
JavaScript, I know quite a bit of JavaScript.
## 📫 How to reach me:  
You may check out my GitHub site as of now, even thought it doesn't have a "contact me" option yet :P
## 😄 Pronouns:  
I prefer he/him but you may use _lord/king_.
## ⚡ Fun fact:  
A small percentage of the static you see on "dead" tv stations is left over radiation from the Big Bang. You're seeing residual effects of the Universe's creation.
